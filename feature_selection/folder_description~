This folder has 3 subfolders for the three types of feature selection strategies which are embedded, filter and wrapper.
All these feature selection strategies are applied on 34 features extracted by pyAudioAnalysis only for train data of BUZZ2 dataset.

The embedded folder contains the RF_feature_importance.py script which determines the importance of features using random forest feature importance plot.

The filter folder contains 1 sub folder (saved_models) and 3 python scripts (ReliefF.py, univariate_feature_selection.py, univariate_validation.py):
The saved_models folder contains all the trained models saved through python pickle library.
The script ReliefF.py determines feature importance using ReliefF feature importance plot.
The univariate_feature_selection.py and univariate_validation.py scripts determines important features using various statistical tests (chi2, f_classif, mutual_info_classif) and uses those features to train-test and validate on BUZZ2 dataset respectively.

The wrapper folder contains 1 sub folder (saved_models) and 4 python scripts (RFE.py, RFE_validate.py, SFS.py, SFS_validate.py):
The saved_models folder contains all the trained models saved through python pickle library.
The scripts RFE.py and RFE_validate.py selects the best subset of features using recursive feature elimination and then uses those features to train-test and validate on BUZZ2 dataset respectively.
The scripts SFS.py and SFS_validate.py selects the best subset of features using sequential forward selection and then uses those features to train-test and validate on BUZZ2 dataset respectively.
